each relationship and how it can be applied to the superadmin, admin, editor, and user models.

One To One: In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one table is associated with exactly one record in another table. For example, if a superadmin can have one admin assigned to them, you can define a one-to-one relationship between the superadmin and admin models. This can be achieved by adding a foreign key to the admin table referencing the primary key of the superadmin table.

One To Many: In a one-to-many relationship, a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table. For example, if an admin can have multiple editors under them, you can define a one-to-many relationship between the admin and editor models. This can be done by adding an admin_id foreign key column to the editors table.

One To Many (Inverse) / Belongs To: The inverse of a one-to-many relationship is the belongs to relationship. In this relationship, the child model belongs to a single parent model. For example, an editor belongs to an admin, so you can define a belongs to relationship between the editor and admin models. The editor model would have an admin_id foreign key column referencing the primary key of the admin table.

Has One Of Many: In a has one of many relationship, a model can have one related model from a set of possible models. For example, a user can have one of either superadmin, admin, editor, or be a regular user. You can achieve this by using a polymorphic relationship in Laravel.

Has One Through: In a has one through relationship, a model has a one-to-one relationship through another model. For example, if a superadmin can have a direct relationship with an editor through an admin, you can define a has one through relationship between the superadmin and editor models using the admin model as an intermediary.

Has Many Through: In a has many through relationship, a model has a one-to-many relationship through another model. For example, if a superadmin can have multiple editors through an admin, you can define a has many through relationship between the superadmin and editor models using the admin model as an intermediary.
