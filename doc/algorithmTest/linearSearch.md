Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element in a list or array sequentially until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached. It starts from the beginning and compares each element with the target value until a match is found.

In web development, linear search can be used in various scenarios, such as:

Filtering and Searching: Linear search can be used to search for specific items or filter data based on certain criteria. For example, in an e-commerce website, you can implement a search feature using linear search to find products based on their names or attributes.

Autocomplete and Suggestions: Linear search can be used to provide autocomplete suggestions as users type in search boxes or input fields. It can be helpful in dynamically searching and suggesting options based on the entered text.

Pagination: Linear search can be used for pagination functionality. It allows users to navigate through a large dataset by sequentially retrieving and displaying a portion of the data at a time.

User Lists and Directories: In web applications that manage user accounts or directories, linear search can be used to find specific users based on their names, emails, or other attributes.
