Installation Guide
Please follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/diusazzad/algorithms_visualization.git
Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed on your machine. You can check if they are installed by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
php --version
composer --version
Navigate to the project's directory:

bash
Copy code
cd algorithms_visualization
Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Generate a new application key:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
Update the .env file with your database configuration. You may need to create an empty database before proceeding.

Install the project dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
Run the database migrations:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
Optionally, you can seed the database with sample data (if provided by the project):

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
Generate the application's asset files:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm run dev
Finally, start the Laravel development server:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
You should see a message like "Laravel development server started" along with the server's URL. Open that URL in your web browser to access the project.

Feel free to explore and learn from the project.
